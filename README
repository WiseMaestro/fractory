# fractory

FIXME: Fractory is what it sounds like. It is a quick and easy factory for super cool fractal images. Check out seahorse valley online, then generate it yourself and have your mind blown.

## Usage

FIXME: I'll get to this part. I haven't written the nice macros (mactrals) yet, so calling the proper functions is clumsy.
